# About me

Hey ! I am Anthony Granger, a 21 years old developper living in the center of France. Apparently you got lost on my website but, hey, **stay calm** ! Everything will be ok.

### What am I doing ?

With a high school diploma in sciences and a two years university degree in technology, I am currently having sandwich courses in order to be an IT manager. I am working in web development, both frontend and backend. Even if code is fun, I also take care of Linux servers with all my love and always help other in order to find the best optimized way to do stuff... Well, in reality I *would like* to make things run in the most optimal way possible, but I just try to move towards.

As you may already know, I am a free software enthusiast. Feeding penguins all day long and sharing them with my little world. In fact, you are reading a page written with a free software ([Vim](http://www.vim.org/)), rendered with an another free one ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) and served by a machine running under Linux.

And remember, a free software is...

> free as in free speech not as in free beer, *Richard Stallman*

Oh and, very important, I *love* music. Not only listening to it, but also playing clarinet and piano.

### My website

This website is entirerly **open sourced**, so feel free to have a look inside via my GitHub. You can, also, send me issues if anything here is not working well for you. I will always try to answer you as fast as possible ! Even if this is a personnal website, contributions from all over the world are permitted and encouraged.
